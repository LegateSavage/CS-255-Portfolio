# CS-255-Portfolio
The client DriverPass for a team to develop a system to help resolve the issue with high fail rates on drivers test.
To address this issue the client wanted to make a systme that allowed users to select from three driving packages to help the prepare for upcoming driving tests.
This included allowing users to book appointments, take practice exams, study material, pay for plans, take online classes etc.

Overall I feel like I designed the UML diagrams and did explainations of the expectations of the system pretty well.

If I could revise one part of my final document it would likely be the security aspect. Security solutions in the computer science field are ever evolving therfore making changes to the security plan may be frequent.

I like to approach software design through a slow analysis of the user requirements to help me determine what the clients expect from the software, I then develop a plan on how to go forward with the software design based on that information.
